model_test.py - use to test it
bruce_model.py is the code that is used to create the model
In the data folder you will find pictures of Bruce Willis and some of different men.
Right now, the data is not enough for the model to predict correctly. Still need more data for that.

Run bruce_model.py - it will generate the model (maybe with the name - bruce_willis_model.h5)

Unfortunately I am not able to upload the model, because the size is too large.
